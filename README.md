# Cafés

Cafés provides school administrators, teachers, students, parents and many others with a Covid-19 risk assessment for schools in the given county. The Covid-19 risk assessment is generated from data that is updated daily and provides an estimated risk of Covid-19 transmission in schools based on [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/indicators.html#thresholds).
